# Wakame-vdc
<span>Wakame-VDC is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing framework, facilitating the provisioning and management of a heterogeneous virtualized infrastructure. Wakame-vdc virtualizes the entire data center; servers, storage, and networking. Wakame-vdc is managed via a native Web Interface, the Wakame-vdc CLI, or the powerful Wakame-vdc API.</span>

## About
Wakame-vdc is Datacenter Level Hypervisor, and gives your infrastructure higher portability. Since it is fully Open Sourced, with Wakame-vdc you are free to design and extend your own datacenter. Wakame-vdc provides the best method to build your cloud infrastructure. Enjoy!  

### Overview

### Wakame-vdc's Goal

Wakame-vdc allows the administrator to spend less time managing the entire data center infrastructure.

Wakame-vdc strives to provide the same experience to the entire data center, as virtual machines have done for operating systems. The VDC (Virtual Data Center) offers virtualized facilities such as servers, storage, and networking, in what can be described as a data center level hypervisor. Deployment, migration and backup of a Wakame-vdc installation can freely be replicated between any site running Wakame-vdc, with minimal reconfiguration.
