Wakame-vdc is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing framework, facilitating the provisioning and management of a heterogeneous virtualized infrastructure. Wakame-vdc virtualizes the entire data center; servers, storage, and networking. Wakame-vdc is managed via a native Web Interface, the Wakame-vdc CLI, or the powerful Wakame-vdc API.

Wakame-vdc is a Datacenter Level Hypervisor, and gives your infrastructure higher portability. Since it is fully Open Sourced, with Wakame-vdc you are free to design and extend your own datacenter. Wakame-vdc provides the best method to build your cloud infrastructure. Enjoy!

### Quick Start

This is the fastest most painless way to get yourself a working Wakame-vdc environment to play with. Just download the image, follow the VirtualBox setup steps and you're good to go.

This guide will teach you how to install Wakame-vdc on your own server. The end result will be similar to the VirtualBox image but since you're installing everything yourself, you will learn much more about the different components that make up Wakame-vdc.
