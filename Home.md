### What is Wakame-vdc?

There are a couple of ways you could answer this question.

* Wakame-vdc is a virtual datacenter. You may have heard of virtual machines. Those virtualize a single computer. What Wakame-vdc does is virtualize an entire datacenter. More on that on the [[virtual datacenter concept|virtual-datacenter-concept]] page.

* Wakame-vdc is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud computing framework. Basically you can set it up and offer server infrastructure *"up in the cloud"*. Users can control Wakame-vdc through a web browser. That means you can for example set up Wakame-vdc on your physical data center, and then hire out virtual servers to users. Some of the companies [[currently using Wakame-vdc|home#usage]] do just that.

Wakame-vdc is free open source software. The source is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/axsh/wakame-vdc) and everybody is welcome to contribute to development or distribute the software. (Within the rules of the LGPL license)

This is the fastest most painless way to get yourself a working Wakame-vdc environment to play with. Just download the image, follow the VirtualBox setup steps and you're good to go.

This guide will teach you how to install Wakame-vdc on your own server. The end result will be similar to the VirtualBox image but since you're installing everything yourself, you will learn much more about the different components that make up Wakame-vdc.
